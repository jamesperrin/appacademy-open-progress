## How to Ask a Great Question

- 15 minute rule: Ask a question if you've been stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes
- Try it out in a REPL: If you are curious/unsure about how a line of code will execute, try it out in a REPL
- Take time formulating your question: A good question is specific, clear, concise, and shows you put work into it
- Use a search engine: Look up your question to see if someone else asked a similar question to you and got an answer
- Use official documentation: Explore documentation like MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) for questions about syntax or usage of an operation or function
- Ask an instructor: Ask your formulated question to an instructor during a discussion
- Ask your peers: Ask your formulated question during a study circle
