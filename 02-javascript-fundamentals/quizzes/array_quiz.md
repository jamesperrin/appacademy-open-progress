Fill in the blank for the following: A(n) _____ is an ordered list of values defined by using square brackets.
```

A: Array

```
let groceries = ["apples", "potatoes", "milk"];
What is the above groceries variable?
```

A: Array

```
let puppies = ["Laser", "Katy", "Jet", "Layla"];
What is the value we'd receive if we read the value at puppies[1]?
```
A: "Katy"

```
let groceries = ["apples", "potatoes", "milk"];

Which of the following are the correct ways to access the value of "milk" in the above groceries array?

```

A: groceries[2], groceries[groceries.length - 1]

```
let age = 30;

if (age > 30) {
  console.log("older than 30");
} else {
  console.log("younger than 30");
}

Predict what will happen in the above example. Which console.log will actually print?
```

A: prints"younger than 30"

```

  console.log("I am potato!");
}
function sadSpeak() {
  console.log("I am NOT potato :(");
}

function isThisPotato(word) {
  if (word === "potato") {
    potatoSpeak();
  } else {
    sadSpeak();
  }
}
In the code snippet above we have written a function that accepts one word and if that word is "potato" the potatoSpeak function is called - otherwise the sadSpeak function is called. The condition inside the isThisPotato function above is an example of what kind of conditional?

```

A: mutually exclusive
