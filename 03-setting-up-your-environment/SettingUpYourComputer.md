## Environment Setup - Windows

You'll need to install some basic development tools to complete these activities. There are a few different ways to accomplish this, but please use the method below. It's good practice for how you'll normally install other tools as a developer!

### Operating System

Much of the software you will be using is updated regularly and will eventually stop working on older versions of operating systems. You can save yourself many tears by making sure that you keep your OS up-to-date:

1. Search for "system information" in the Windows Search Bar and open the System Information panel. If you do not have a search bar, or your OS Name is not some variation of "Windows 10" or "Windows 11", please see the note in the article in Part 5: Analysis of My Computer for information on updating older versions of Windows.
1. Search for "update" in the Windows Search Bar.
1. Click "Check for Updates".
1. In the window that opens, click the "Check for Updates" button.
1. Follow the prompts on screen to install all available updates.

### Environment Set Up for Windows

You will be following the setup instructions contained in the [App Academy Unified Setup Instructions](https://github.com/appacademy/practice-for-SETUP-unified-setup/blob/main/00-README.md) repository. This repository contains instructions for installing all of the software you will use in the online course. While you will not need to install Python or Docker to complete the Prepwork, you are encouraged to do so now so you will be ready for the course.

Please follow the instructions and commands exactly. While you are normally strongly encouraged to experiment changing parts of the code examples you learn, this can cause problems with environment setup.

When you are finished setting up your computer, run the command in the [Checking Your Setup](https://github.com/appacademy/practice-for-SETUP-unified-setup/blob/main/10-checking-your-setup.md) lesson. Every environment is different, so you may need to do some trouble-shooting to get this to work.

## Environment Setup - Linux

You'll need to install some basic development tools to complete these activities. We've provided brief instructions, but if you are using Linux, it's up to you to find and use the correct method to set up the software for your specific implementation and settings.

### The responsibility of choosing Linux

With great power (and a price tag of zero) comes great responsibility. If you choose to use Linux as your development platform, you're taking on complete responsibility to figure out and make the specific configurations necessary to get everything working on your device.

If you don't know what that means and don't already have an approach in mind, it is best to use Windows or Mac for this experience. Learning to be a developer is extremely challenging and struggling with Linux environment issues will add to that.

You'll notice that our instructions for Linux are much briefer than for other operating systems. This is because many steps need to be adjusted to work on different implementations of Linux. There may be different commands, different files, or additional steps.

### Environment Set Up for Linux

You will be following the setup instructions contained in the [App Academy Unified Setup Instructions](https://github.com/appacademy/practice-for-SETUP-unified-setup/blob/main/00-README.md) repository. After completing setup, follow the instructions for [Checking Your Setup](https://github.com/appacademy/practice-for-SETUP-unified-setup/blob/main/10-checking-your-setup.md).
